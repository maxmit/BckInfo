		<h2>BckupNix Contributors Needed</h2><br>

<strong>How to Contribute to this Project [BckupNix]</strong>

<p>Thank you for looking at this document, there are many ways in which you can help, keep reading to learn more.</p>

<p>My open source project involves building and creating a backup application/program which is called BckupNix (yep another backup program) that works for Linux/Unix systems. Eventually I’d like to make versions portable across all the platforms (Windows, MacOS, and Linux), but for now, since my OS is Linux, I’m using that environment as my test bed.</p><br> 


<strong><u>Documents:</u></strong> 
<p>This project needs people who can create, read, and modify documents (PDF s, Docx, PowerPoint, etc). Writing clear, easy, and simple to follow documents is very important to this project.</p><br>

<strong><u>Content Creators:</u></strong>
<p>If you can create videos, presentations, online seminars, video editors, this would help the project as well.</p><br>

<strong><u>Testers:</u></strong>
<p>The application [BckupNix] is currently created on python3, so you should be able to run this script with some slight modifications per your OS. We definitely need you to test this application.</p><br> 

<strong><u>Programmers-Coders:</u></strong>
<p>Anyone who can program in Python3 should be able to handle this project easily. This is for a backup application, that currently has a few lines of code in it. My daily driver OS is Linux Mint so if you have similar environment, you should be able to do this project.</p> However, even if you DON'T have Linux, you should be able to run this script with some slight modifications per your OS.</p> 

<h2>Start Learning</h2>

<p> Want to learn how to code/program but don't know where to start, youtube is a great place to go, I would suggest learning Python3 (as that is what I'm currently using for this project).</p>

<p>Need help installing Python in your environment, go straight to the source, go to Python.org for guidance:<br>
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python.org</a></p>

<p>Need help running Python, in a windows environment, again, go to the source:<br>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows">How do I run a Python program under Windows</a></p>

<p>Want to know how to run Python without installing it on your computer, go to this site<br>
<a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a></p>

<p>This video series from Kris Occhipinti <strong><u>(warning, he does use a Linux environment for all his coding, other than that, you should be able to follow along)</u></strong> helped me start learning Python3, they are quick and easy for a beginner, check him out:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3dSzrRUFb8&list=PLcUid3OP_4OUakQfcLmaQADU3nqGXantN">Python3 Tutorials</a></p>

<p>Want to learn how to use Linux in general, go to my youtube site, and take your pick, hope you learn and enjoy them:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/gmax411/playlists">My Linux and other videos</a></p>

<p>To contribute to this project, you need to know how to use Git & Git hub, again I suggest youtube, and this video by Faraday Academy:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9Tb76tBoFU">Intro to Git & Github | Learn version control from the web & the command line</a><br>
