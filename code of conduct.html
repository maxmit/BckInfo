		<h2>BckupNix Code of Conduct</h2><br>

<strong>Intent:</strong> 
<p>The intent of this community (you know who you are) and all concerned is to provide an environment in which we all can express ourselves in a creative, honest, yet safe and nurturing way. In short, treat each other the way you want to be treated, if you would not like it, chances are neither would any of us.</p> 

<strong>Good Behavior:</strong>
<p>Try or attempt to be helpful, creative, honest, and sensitive of other peoples (everyone else in the community) feelings, work, and contributions. Be mindful of your work and other peoples work, constructive criticism is fine, but don’t be down-right rude and mean.</p> 

<strong>Bad Behavior:</strong>
<p>No cursing (yeah I know, me neither), harassing, trolling, abusing, flaming, or any other bad, rude behavior not mentioned in this document, if you can’t say anything nice, please don’t say anything (as mentioned constructive criticism is OK, but don’t be mean).</p>

<strong>Protective Action:</strong> 
<p>Internet, community, and online safety and awareness is everyone’s responsibility, so if you see any potential issues, please report them.</p>

<p>1 – First offense will be a written warning to please stop.</p>

<p>2 – Second offense will be another written as well as asking the offender to not interact with the offended (or some type of mediation will be warranted).</p> 

<p>3 – Third offense, will lead to a ban from the community (length of ban, TBD)</p>
