		<h2>BckupNix Community Document</h2><br>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in building a backup software program [called BckupNix] that can backup my systems easily and quickly. I already built a program using Python3, but it needs improvement. Now I know there are already plenty of applications on the market, but I thought, building my own application would resolve two main issues:</p> 

    <p>1. I want to learn how to program anyway with python3 so this would be a good project to start with.<br>
    <p>2. I also want to learn more about open source projects and programming in general, so I figure this is a good place to start.</p><br>


<strong>Vision:</strong> 
<p>The vision of this project is to build, modify, and use a simple tool to backup and protect computer systems (software) without any difficult or complex use of the tool (application).</p> 

<p>I want this backup tool to not only be simple to use, but simple to build and to implement into any computer operating system, making it cross platform compatible and portable into multiple environments.</p><br>

<strong>Mission:</strong>
<p>The mission of this community and the project will be to use open source tools, documentation, and programs (Python3 in this case), to create a application that is beneficial and helpful to everyone who is interested in protecting and keeping their systems safe from harms way.</p><br>

<strong>Values:</strong> 
<p>I want to make this project and the community that supports it, VERY easy to join, contribute to, and collaborate with, whether you can code or not.</p> 

<p>Everyone, no matter what our differences are, should feel free to join this community, and input your talents to helping not only the project but all of us the world over.</p><br>
