	<p>This project is not for the purpose of creating the next BIG backup tool/application. This project is to learn how to code in Python3, and application building. Hopefully all users in this project will use it to learn programming skills that can be used in their careers as a stepping stone for better --> coders, programmers, technical writers, content creators, and engineers.</p>
	<p> What does this script do? this is a script to clean up
the files and folders into a nice and neat folder. You could use this
script as a backup script</p>
	<p> I got the original idea from this youtube video by Prasanth Louis::<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COvS9ncnEj4">Develop your first Python Script! A simple desktop cleaner</a></p><br>

<strong>Script details & function</strong>
<p>Script Name - BckupNix</p>
<p>Version - 001</p>
<p>Written in Python3</p>
<p>License - MIT License</p>
<p>Script Function:<br>
To clean up multiple files and folders in your directory into one directory/folder.</p>

<h2>Start Learning</h2>

<p> Want to learn how to code/program but don't know where to start, youtube is a great place to go, I would suggest learning Python3 (as that is what I'm currently using for this project).</p>

<p>Need help installing Python in your environment, go straight to the source, go to Python.org for guidance:<br>
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python.org</a></p>

<p>Need help running Python, in a windows environment, again, go to the source:<br>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows">How do I run a Python program under Windows</a></p>

<p>Want to know how to run Python without installing it on your computer, go to this site<br>
<a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a></p>

<p>This video series from Kris Occhipinti <strong><u>(warning, he does use a Linux environment for all his coding, other than that, you should be able to follow along)</u></strong> helped me start learning Python3, they are quick and easy for a beginner, check him out:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3dSzrRUFb8&list=PLcUid3OP_4OUakQfcLmaQADU3nqGXantN">Python3 Tutorials</a></p>

<p>Want to learn how to use Linux in general, go to my youtube site, and take your pick, hope you learn and enjoy them:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/gmax411/playlists">My Linux and other videos</a></p>

<p>To contribute to this project, you need to know how to use Git & Git hub, again I suggest youtube, and this video by Faraday Academy:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9Tb76tBoFU">Intro to Git & Github | Learn version control from the web & the command line</a><br>

<p>Need further help, have further questions, contact me, Max at:<br>
